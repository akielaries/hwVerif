# Exploring Hardware Verification
This repo serves as a test/sandbox for working with hardware specific
languages while testing some of my own electronic creations of 
varying complexity. 

Most of the work will be done on the hardware side meaning schematics
will also be available. The simulations/verifications aim to provide
insight and serve as a learning process to integrate some of my own
circuit creations inspired from EE/CE.
