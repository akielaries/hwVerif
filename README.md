# Exploring Hardware Verification
> **Warning** This repo is dedicated to exerimentation while I 
> brainstorm some application of the work done here.

This repo serves as a test/sandbox for working with hardware specific
languages while testing some of my own electronic creations of 
varying complexity. 

Since this repo is focused on hardware, schecmatics will also be 
available. The simulations/verifications aim to provide insight and 
serve as a learning process for hardware related tasks on my own 
circuit based projects.
