# Exploring Hardware Verification
Another repo I use for tinkering with hardware.

# Tools
* Using **iverilog** for working with Verilog files and generating files
necessary for syntehsis.
* **NVC** & **GHDL** for doing the with VHDL. 
* **Verilator** for working with System Verilog files.
* **GTKWave** to visualize signals/running simulations. 
* **cocotb** for experimenting with test bench generation.
* **Yosys** for synthesis and generating schematics.
